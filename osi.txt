OSI Model

Application Layer:
Application layer provides services to Network Applications (Chrome, Outlook, Skype)
 with the help of application layer protocols (HTTP/S, SMTP, Telnet, FTP),.
-FTP is the basis for file transfer service.
-SMTP is the basis for emailing service.
-HTTP/S is the basis for web surfing.
-Telnet is the basis for virtual terminals.

Presentation Layer:
Receives data from the application layer as characters and numbers and converts them
to machine readable format.
-It translates between character set encodings for example converting ASCII to EBCDIC code
whenever necessary.This layer can convert different types of data formats to ensure that the 
sender and receiver are on the same page. 
Example: If one system uses EBCDIC encoding and another uses ASCII encoding, the Presentation Layer 
will translate the EBCDIC encoded data into ASCII at the receiving end.
-This layer compresses data to reduce the size of data to be transmitted and decompresses it at 
the receiving end to save bandwidth and improve transfer speeds.
-It ensures that the data is securely transmitted by encrypting it before sending and decrypting 
it upon arrival.
In essence, the Presentation Layer acts as the data translator, encryptor, and compressor, ensuring smooth 
and secure communication between different systems.
